 * Optional, local, in-process text embedding provider (transformers.js +
 * onnxruntime-node). Coexists with the remote-provider embedding route — it is
 * NOT a replacement. Seeded as a built-in AI provider/model so the knowledge
 * base can offer it before its weights have been downloaded.
 *
 * Runtime model details (HF repo, dtype, runtime device) live in the main
 * process engine (`src/main/ai/provider/custom/localEmbedding`), not here —
 * this module only holds the cross-process identity constants for the local
 * embedding provider/model, shared between the main-process seeder and
 * the renderer's embedding-dimensions hook.
