# Teams Review

You are the **coordinator**. Dispatch reviewer, verifier, and fixer agents with
the runtime-provided subagent coordination tools. Never modify source files
directly. Read code only for arbitration, diagnosis, and fix verification.

Independent subagent capability is a hard prerequisite. Before entering this
flow, confirm the runtime can launch at least one reviewer and then a fresh
verifier in a separate session with no shared conversation history. Parallel
execution is optional. If it has no
subagent capability, stop following this file and route to `local-review.md`
with `LIMITED_SINGLE_AGENT = true`; coordinator self-verification cannot
replace the reviewer–verifier mechanism.

Follow `SKILL.md` § Interaction and interruption contract. This flow introduces
no additional prompt category beyond its declared failed-fix cleanup safety
blocker. Fixing happens only when the invocation explicitly authorized it
(`AUTHORIZED_FIX`); all other invocations are report-only.

The reviewer–verifier adversarial pair is the core quality mechanism: reviewers
find issues, verifiers challenge them. They run in separate sessions and share
no conversation history. The verifier receives only normalized findings and the
minimum scope/evidence needed to test them. Do not pass reviewer conversation
history, scratch artifact files, or incidental/raw tool output unless a specific
artifact or excerpt is explicitly required as evidence.

## Input from SKILL.md

- `REVIEW_TARGET`, the resolved review scope, and `SMALL_SCOPE`, all derived
  by `SKILL.md` § Scope derivation.
- `AUTHORIZED_FIX`: `true` only when the invocation explicitly granted
  fixing (`fix` modifier or equivalent user wording); commit and range
  targets are always report-only. When false, skip Phase 4 entirely —
  every confirmed issue is reported, none is fixed.
- `HAS_SUBAGENTS`: must be `true`. If false or absent because the runtime
  cannot launch subagents, return to the route above instead of continuing.

## Flow

```
Authorized fix:        Scope → Product gate → Review → Filter → Fix/Validate → Report
Report-only (default): Scope → Product gate → Review → Filter → Report
```

The **Product gate** is stage 1 of `SKILL.md` § Review Stages, run by the
coordinator before dispatching any reviewer. Apply its semantic-impact and
decision-evidence rules without collapsing the no-impact,
established-direction, and open-decision states. Only an open product decision
may prompt in an interactive run or use record-only behavior in an explicitly
automated run; carry the latter's product-impact summary into the Report.
Reviewers cover stages 2–5.

- **Filter** routes issues per `judgment-matrix.md` § Handling by Risk Level,
  which owns the risk-to-action mapping. If nothing is fixable, skip directly
  to Report.

---

## Phase 1: Scope

Scope, resolved-scope emptiness, and `SMALL_SCOPE` are owned by `SKILL.md`
§ Scope derivation. The router already resolved them; when invoked
standalone, derive them with those rules and print its usage examples if the
resolved scope is empty. Do not restate the derivation here.

### Associated PR conversation

If `gh` is available, check whether the current branch has an open PR:
```
gh pr view --json number,state --jq 'select(.state == "OPEN") | .number' 2>/dev/null
```
If an open PR exists, collect the complete accessible conversation state using
`pr-review.md` Step 2: `PR_REVIEWS`, `PR_CONVERSATION_COMMENTS`, whole
`REVIEW_THREADS`, and the current reviewer's pending draft. Preserve their state
and visibility boundaries. When this engine was entered through `pr-review.md`,
reuse the wrapper's already collected data.

Also inspect its CI checks with `gh pr checks`. Record failing, pending, and
successful checks as review evidence. Do not run local lint, test, or format
commands during review.

### CI baseline

When an associated PR exists, use `gh pr checks` as the validation baseline and
record failing or pending jobs. If no PR exists, state that CI validation is
unavailable and continue with static review only. Never substitute a local
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, or `pnpm format` run.

### Module partition

Partition files in scope into **review modules** for parallel review. Each
module is a self-contained logical unit. Split large files by section/function
group; group related small files together. Classify each module as `code`,
`doc`, or `mixed`.

Suggested module boundaries for this project:
- `src/main/data/` — DataApi handlers, data services, migrations, schemas
- `src/main/core/` — lifecycle, application, windows, paths, logger
- `src/main/services/` — Main-process business services and side effects
- `src/renderer/data/` — DataApi hooks, Cache, Preference, renderer stores
- `src/renderer/` — React UI components, hooks, pages, features, windows
- `packages/aiCore/` — AI SDK middleware & providers
- `src/shared/` — Cross-process primitives, DataApi/IpcApi schemas, types, pure utilities
- `packages/ui/` — Shared UI primitives
- `src/shared/ipc/`, `src/main/ipc/`, `src/preload/`, `src/renderer/ipc/` — IpcApi contract and bridge
- `docs/references/data/` — Data architecture documentation
- `.agents/skills/` — Agent skills and review instructions

### Issue tracking

The coordinator tracks all issues in memory throughout the session. Each issue
has:
- Brief description
- Status: `reported` | `fixed` | `failed`
- Risk: low | medium | high
- File: file path:line
- Fix options, trade-offs, and optional recommendation (medium/high risk only)

---

## Phase 2: Review

### Agent setup

Launch agents with the coordination tools exposed by the current runtime:

- One independent reviewer per module.
- One fresh independent **verifier** in a separate session, launched after all
  reviewers complete.

Do not prescribe tool names, agent types, or parameters the runtime does not
expose. Keep reviewer and verifier conversation histories separate; pass tasks
through the runtime's spawn/delegate interface and collect their returned
reports. The coordinator, not the verifier, normalizes reviewer output for the
handoff below.

Launch reviewers concurrently when the runtime supports parallel subagents.
If it cannot run subagents in parallel, launch the same agents sequentially —
phases, prompts, and reviewer/verifier context separation are unchanged.

### Reviewer prompt

Stance: **thorough** — discover as many real issues as possible, self-verify
before submitting.

Each reviewer receives:
- **Scope**: file list + changed line ranges for its module. Reviewers fetch
  diffs and read additional context themselves as needed — coordinator does NOT
  pass raw diff or file contents.
- **Checklist**: `code-checklist.md` for code, `doc-checklist.md` for doc, both
  for mixed. Include the checklist content verbatim in the reviewer prompt.
  Include `cherry-review-guidance.md` verbatim for code, mixed, architecture
  documentation, and project-skill modules. For doc-only modules outside Cherry
  architecture/policies, include it only when the document describes project
  behavior, paths, tools, or review rules.
  For React/performance-heavy modules, also include relevant rules from
  `vercel-react-best-practices` skill as supplementary checks.
- **Stages**: run `SKILL.md` § Review Stages 2–5 in order for the module.
  For a module whose diff adds or expands shared surface — judged by diff
  semantics, never by change label — include
  `consumer-review.md` verbatim and run it first — report its per-surface
  decision, and review implementation quality only for surviving surfaces.
- **Mandatory docs**: before reviewing, read the docs required by
  `cherry-review-guidance.md` § Mandatory Baseline Docs for the processes the
  module touches, plus its on-demand docs for touched subsystems. Review
  architecture-first — placement, ownership, and abstraction integrity against
  those docs before line-level detail. Any non-conformance with them is a
  finding at Warning minimum.
- **Evidence requirement**: every issue must have a code citation (file:line +
  snippet) from the current tree.
- **Checklist exclusion**: see the exclusion section in the corresponding
  checklist. Project rules loaded in context take priority.
- **Self-check**: before submitting, re-read the relevant code and verify each
  issue. Mark as confirmed or withdrawn. Only submit confirmed issues. If a cited
  path/line no longer exists, locate the correct file/path via `git diff --name-only`
  or file search before reporting.
- **Output format**: `[file:line] [A/B/C] — [description] — [key lines]`

**PR conversation reviewer** (when prior review threads exist): one additional
agent to verify each whole thread's current conclusion against current code,
using its root, all replies, and resolved/outdated state together. Review
summaries and ordinary conversation comments are separate context. Same output
format, same verification pipeline.

### Verification

Stance: **adversarial** — default to doubting the reviewer, actively look for
reasons each issue is wrong. Reject with real evidence, confirm if it holds up.
This step is mandatory — the coordinator MUST NOT skip it or perform
verification itself. **Exception**: if every reviewer explicitly reports zero
issues (LGTM / no issues found), skip verification and proceed directly to
Phase 3.

After all reviewer agents complete, normalize every finding to its issue claim,
current `file:line` citation and snippet, reviewer reasoning, and the minimum
module scope or evidence needed to test it. Launch a single verifier agent in a
fresh session with that normalized list. Do not include reviewer conversation
history, full reports, scratch artifact files, or incidental/raw tool output;
include a specifically identified artifact or excerpt only when it is required
to verify a finding. Include the following verbatim in the verifier's prompt:

```
You are a code review verifier. Your stance is adversarial — default to doubting the
reviewer's conclusion and actively look for reasons why the issue might be wrong. Your
job is to stress-test each issue so that only real problems survive.

For each issue you receive:

1. Read the cited code (file:line) and sufficient surrounding context.
2. Actively try to disprove the issue: Is the reviewer's reasoning flawed? Is there
   context that makes this a non-issue (e.g., invariants guaranteed by callers, platform
   constraints, intentional design)? Does the code actually behave as the reviewer
   claims? Look for the strongest counter-argument you can find.
3. Output for each issue:
   - Verdict: REJECT or CONFIRM
   - Reasoning: for REJECT, state the concrete counter-argument. For CONFIRM, briefly
     note what you checked and why no valid counter-argument exists.

Important constraints:
- Your counter-arguments must be grounded in real evidence from the code. Do not
  fabricate hypothetical defenses or invent caller guarantees that are not visible in
  the codebase.
- A CONFIRM verdict is not a failure — it means the reviewer found a real issue and
  your challenge validated it.
```

### After review

Before entering Phase 3, confirm: (1) all reviewers have submitted their final
reports; (2) the verifier has given a CONFIRM/REJECT verdict for every finding,
OR all reviewers reported zero issues and verification was skipped.

---

## Phase 3: Filter — coordinator only

Your stance here is **neutral** — trust no single party. Treat reviewer reports
and verifier rebuttals as equally weighted inputs. Use your project-wide view to
consider cross-module impact, conventions, and architectural intent that local
reviewers may miss.

### 3.1 De-dup

Remove cross-reviewer duplicates (same location, same topic).

### 3.2 Existence check

| Verifier verdict | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| CONFIRM | Plausibility check — verify description matches cited code. Read code if anything looks off. |
| REJECT | Read code. Evaluate both arguments. Drop only if counter-argument is sound. |

### 3.3 Risk level

Consult `judgment-matrix.md` for risk level assessment, worth-fixing criteria,
handling by risk level, and special rules.

**Fix guidance** (Medium/High only): record the feasible at-altitude options,
their key trade-offs, and an optional reviewer recommendation with reasoning.
Never record any option as already chosen. Low risk has a single obvious fix
and needs no extra guidance. Every option must sit at the defect's altitude per
`cherry-review-guidance.md` § Fix Recommendation Policy: minimal correction
for local bugs, root-cause fix for structural symptoms, architecture-conformant
relocation for boundary/entity-leakage issues. A below-altitude patch (side
table, metadata flag, extra special case, symptom-only fix for a structural
cause) must not enter the auto-fix queue; report the issue with the
at-altitude options instead.

### 3.4 Route

All confirmed issues are recorded with risk level.

Route each issue per `judgment-matrix.md` § Handling by Risk Level: what it
sends to the auto-fix queue goes to Phase 4, everything else is `reported`
with fix guidance.

- Cross-module impact: if a fix requires updates outside the fixer's module,
  add it to the current fix queue and assign to the appropriate fixer.

Phase 4 if the auto-fix queue is non-empty; otherwise jump to Phase 5
(Report). Never ask the user which issues to fix.

---

## Phase 4: Fix/Validate

Runs only when `AUTHORIZED_FIX` is true and the auto-fix queue is non-empty.

### Fix

Stance: **precise** — apply each fix completely and correctly, never expand
scope. The coordinator MUST NOT apply fixes directly.

**Agent assignment**: launch fixer agents with the runtime-provided coordination
tools. Prefer reusing an existing reviewer only when the runtime preserves that
agent's context; otherwise start a fixer with the minimum verified issue context:

- Issue in a file that a reviewer already analyzed → include that context in the
  fixer prompt.
- Cross-module issues → single fixer agent with all relevant file paths.
- Multi-file renames → single atomic task assigned to one agent.

One agent may receive multiple fix tasks if it covers several files. Avoid
assigning the same file to multiple agents to prevent concurrent edit conflicts.

Each fixer receives (include verbatim in every fixer prompt):

```
Fix rules:
1. Do not stage or commit. The coordinator validates all edits before any commit.
2. Only modify files explicitly assigned by the coordinator.
3. If a fix requires changes to unassigned files, stop and report to the coordinator
   for re-assignment.
4. Keep each issue's edits separable and report the exact changed files.
5. When in doubt, skip the fix rather than risk a wrong change.
6. Do not run build or tests.
7. Do not modify public API function signatures or class definitions (comments are OK),
   unless the coordinator's issue description explicitly requires an API signature fix.
8. After each fix, check whether the change affects related comments or documentation
   within your assigned files (function/class doc-comments, inline comments describing
   the changed logic). If so, update them as part of the same fix.
   Cross-module documentation updates (README, spec files, other modules) are handled
   separately by the coordinator.
9. When done, report the changed files for each fix and list any skipped issues
   with the reason for skipping.
```

Fixers leave all edits uncommitted. The review workflow never stages or
commits fixes even when fixing is authorized. Hand verified patches to a
separate user-authorized publish/commit workflow; that workflow owns the
Conventional Commit with a specific kebab-case scope and `--signoff`. Never
stage pre-existing user changes.

### Verify fixes (coordinator)

Wait for all fixers. Before running validation, the coordinator reads the
working-tree diff for every assigned file and verifies:
1. The fix correctly addresses the original issue
2. No new issues introduced (naming inconsistencies, missing updates in
   surrounding code, logic errors)
3. Fix scope matches the issue — no unintended changes

If a problem is found, launch a correction agent with specific details
(max 1 retry). If the retry fails, mark it `failed`; never discard pre-existing
user changes while removing an unsuccessful fixer edit.

### Validate fixes

Re-read every fixer diff and repeat the relevant reviewer/verifier checks.
Then, because applied fixes make the session a coding task, run the
validation selected per `SKILL.md` § Validation after applied fixes and
include its results in the report. Existing CI validates the reviewed
remote commit, not these unpushed fixes; state that limitation in the report.
If a later user-authorized publish workflow pushes the fixes, inspect the
resulting CI before claiming them fully validated.

- **Verification passes** → mark issues `fixed`, with CI pending when
  the fix is not yet published.
- **Verification fails** → retry via a correction agent with failure
  details (max 2 retries). If still unresolved, mark the issue `failed` and
  treat removal of its exact patch as a safety blocker: in an interactive
  session ask before removing it; in an automated session leave it in place and
  report the required decision. Never reset, checkout, or otherwise discard
  unrelated or pre-existing changes.

### After validation

Proceed to Phase 5 (Report). Failed fixes are reported, not retried with the
user; never discard pre-existing user changes while removing an unsuccessful
fixer edit.

---

## Phase 5: Report

Summary:
- Product Demand summary when the product decision remains open and the
  session was automated: impact, direction, and points needing human
  confirmation, explicitly marked as awaiting a product decision — never as
  approved
- Consumer review decisions per surface, when the diff added or expanded shared surface
- Issues found / fixed (authorized fix only) / reported / failed
- Reported issues listed with risk, `file:line`, and at-altitude fix guidance
  (`cherry-review-guidance.md` § Fix Recommendation Policy); Medium/High
  guidance includes options, trade-offs, and an optional recommendation
- Local validation results (the commands selected per `SKILL.md` §
  Validation after applied fixes) when fixes were applied
- Rolled-back issues and reasons
- Associated PR CI status, or "unavailable" when there is no PR
- Unpushed fixes: CI pending until published
- Issues from prior PR review threads (when they existed)
- Note: "To verify fix quality, run `/gh-pr-review` again."

### Checklist evolution

Review all confirmed issues from this session. If any represent a recurring
pattern not covered by the current checklist, read `checklist-evolution.md` and
record valid candidates as `proposed` in the report. A regular review never
accepts, inserts, or claims to persist checklist rules.
