/**
 * Bound convenience API over the creator-declared reasoning family rules
 * (#16598). This module contains NO family knowledge: rules are DATA in
 * `Creator.reasoningFamilies` (creators/*.ts), compiled by generation into
 * `reasoning-families.gen.ts`; the matcher lives in `reasoning-families.ts`.
 * Adding a new model family = a data edit in its creator + `pnpm generate`.
 *
 * Consumed at INGEST time only — never as a runtime capability source:
 *  - `ModelService` infers controls when a custom-provider model row is
 *    created (or read) without a descriptor.
 * (The generation script consumes the pure matcher + CREATORS directly, so
 * it never depends on the generated artifact.)
