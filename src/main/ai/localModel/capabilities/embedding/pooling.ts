/**
 * L2 normalization for Qwen3-Embedding vectors.
 *
 * transformers.js feature-extraction only offers `mean` / `cls` / `none`
 * pooling, so the inference worker requests `none` (per-token embeddings), takes
 * the final token, and L2-normalizes it — matching Qwen3-Embedding's expected
 * pooling.
 *
 * Single source of the algorithm: the worker runs as an eval'd string and cannot
 * import project modules, so the embedding worker source bakes this exact function
 * into the worker source via `.toString()`. Keeping it here (not inlined in the
 * worker) is what keeps the executed copy unit-tested.
