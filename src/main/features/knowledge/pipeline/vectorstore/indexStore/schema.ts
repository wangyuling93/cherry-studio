/**
 * Per-base knowledge `index.sqlite` schema (7-table material model).
 *
 * This is the schema for the per-knowledge-base index database located at
 * `KnowledgeBase/{baseId}/.cherry/index.sqlite` — a SEPARATE file per base,
 * created fresh at runtime. It is NOT the main app DB and is intentionally
 * NOT managed by drizzle-kit (whose schema glob `src/main/data/db/schemas/**`
 * targets the main DB migration chain). See knowledge-technical-design.md §4.
 *
 * Demand-first surface: tables and enum values ship together with their first
 * writer. Planned v2.x surface (material provenance relations, editable index
 * entries, watcher-driven origins/states) is NOT pre-created, while pre-created
 * vocabulary would lock in guesses. Adding a NEW table later is zero-cost (its
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` simply runs on the next open). Changing an
 * EXISTING table is NOT — `IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op once the table exists, so a
 * new column or a widened CHECK never reaches an already-created file. Such a
 * change must bump {@link KNOWLEDGE_INDEX_SCHEMA_VERSION}; the store-open path
 * then drops and recreates this rebuildable derived index (see
 * {@link resetKnowledgeIndexSchema} and KnowledgeVectorStoreService).
 *
 * Engine portability (technical-design §5.6 / decision A1):
 * - All DDL is plain, engine-neutral SQLite — no engine-specific column types
 *   or functions. The same statements run on better-sqlite3 + sqlite-vec and
 *   would run unchanged on any other SQLite engine, with zero user migration.
 * - `embedding.vector_blob` is a plain `BLOB` holding raw little-endian float32
 *   bytes (a standard SQLite BLOB, engine-portable). Vector similarity is
 *   computed by sqlite-vec's `vec_distance_cosine` scalar function at query
 *   time. No derived ANN index is created in this version.
 * - Because the embedding column is a dimensionless BLOB, the DDL takes no
 *   runtime parameters and is a static statement array — the same shape as
 *   `MESSAGE_FTS_STATEMENTS` in `src/main/data/db/schemas/message.ts`.
 *
 * FTS5 (decision A3):
 * - `search_text_fts` is an external-content FTS5 table over `search_text`,
 *   indexing only the `text` column with the `trigram` tokenizer, kept in sync
 *   by AFTER INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE triggers — copied from the canonical
 *   `message.ts` pattern. `kind` is filtered via the rowid join back to
 *   `search_text`, not stored in the FTS table (so triggers stay minimal).
 * - `search_text_id` is a TEXT business primary key, so it does NOT alias the
 *   SQLite rowid. The FTS table keys on `search_text.fts_rowid` (a stable integer
 *   surrogate the AFTER INSERT trigger assigns), NOT the implicit `rowid`; callers
 *   MUST join `search_text_fts.rowid = search_text.fts_rowid`. Keying on the
 *   implicit rowid would silently desync this external-content index whenever a
 *   VACUUM or table rebuild renumbers it (technical-design §4.7 / §6.2).
 *
 * Foreign keys: this schema relies on `ON DELETE CASCADE` / `SET NULL`. SQLite
 * enforces foreign keys only when `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` is set per
 * connection, OUTSIDE any transaction (it is a no-op inside one). The store
 * opener is responsible for setting it on every connection it opens; this
 * module only declares the schema.
 */

/**
 * Bump when the physical layout of an EXISTING table changes (new column, widened
 * CHECK, retargeted FTS content_rowid, rewritten trigger) — anything `CREATE ...
 * IF NOT EXISTS` cannot retrofit onto an already-created file. The store-open path
 * compares this to the stored `meta.schema_version` and, on a mismatch, drops and
 * recreates the index (a rebuildable derived artifact) before applying the DDL.
 * Adding a brand-new table needs no bump (its IF NOT EXISTS just runs).
 *
 * History: 1 → 2 — `search_text` gained the `fts_rowid` surrogate and the FTS table
 * was re-keyed from the implicit rowid onto it (#16132-class desync fix).
