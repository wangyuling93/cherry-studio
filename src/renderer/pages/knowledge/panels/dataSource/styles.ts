// The checkbox is an inline-level box, so by default it aligns to its text baseline.
// When the check indicator (an SVG) mounts on check, that baseline moves and the whole
// box nudges up/down in the row. `align-middle` aligns it by its box center instead —
// independent of the indicator — so it stays put; `inline-flex items-center justify-center`
// keeps the indicator centered within the box. Applies to both row and header checkboxes.

// Shared column template for the data-source list. The header row and every data
// row use this same grid so columns stay aligned: checkbox / name (flex) / type /
// status / updated-at / actions. The trailing actions column holds a hover-revealed
// "more" button (the same menu as right-click). Each row is its own grid (the
// virtualizer renders them independently), so the meta columns must be fixed widths —
// `auto`/`max-content` would size per-row and break alignment between rows. They're
// tightened to fit their widest label (status fits "File Processing", updated fits
// "59 minutes ago") and stay put on shrink, so the flexible name column absorbs all
// the freed space.
