/**
 * Navigation IPC schemas — go somewhere in the EXISTING main window.
 *
 * SCOPE GUARD: this domain is strictly "navigate-to" — take the running main
 * window (creating it only as a delivery fallback) to a route path. It is NOT
 * "spawn-with": creating a NEW window around content (subWindow tab detach,
 * selection popups, …) takes a full payload (title/icon/metadata/…) and belongs
 * to that window's own service — e.g. SubWindowService for subWindows. A route
 * belongs here only if its input is a main-window route path and nothing else.
 *
 * Two blocks per the framework's two-axis model (see ipc-overview.md):
 *   - Request schemas are zod *values* (renderer→main, untrusted → always parsed).
 *   - Event schemas are pure *types* (main→renderer, main is the TCB → not parsed).
