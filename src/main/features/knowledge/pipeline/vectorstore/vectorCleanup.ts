/**
 * Return the space a subtree delete freed in a base's index.sqlite to the OS.
 * Best-effort: the rows and vectors are already gone, so a reclaim failure (e.g. a
 * transient lock from a concurrent read) must never fail the delete job — it just
 * leaves the freed pages for a later index to reuse. Only VACUUMs when the freelist
 * crossed the driver's threshold (a large delete); otherwise it just truncates the WAL.
 *
 * A corruption-class failure is the exception that gets logged loudly (still swallowed):
 * reclaim's whole-file checkpoint/optimize/VACUUM is often the first op to touch the full
 * file after a delete, so it is where a structurally damaged index surfaces — and folding
 * that into the generic "failed to reclaim" warn would bury it behind benign transient locks.
