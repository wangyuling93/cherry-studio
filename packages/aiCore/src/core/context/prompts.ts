  CONTEXT_COMPACTION_INSTRUCTION: `
You have been working on the task described above but have not yet completed it. Write a continuation summary that will allow you (or another instance of yourself) to resume work efficiently in a future context window where the conversation history will be replaced with this summary.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis></analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. This analysis scratchpad will be stripped from the final output — use it freely to reason through the conversation.

In your analysis:
- Chronologically review what happened in the conversation
- Identify the user's explicit requests, intents, and any clarifications
- Note key decisions, constraints, and information discovered
- Track errors or obstacles encountered and how they were addressed
- Pay attention to specific user feedback, especially corrections

Your final summary (inside <summary></summary> tags) should be structured, concise, and actionable. Include:

1. Task Overview
   The user's core request and success criteria. Any clarifications or constraints specified.

2. Current State
   What has been completed so far. Key outputs, artifacts, or findings produced. Any state or identifiers that need to persist (file paths, URLs, ticket IDs, etc.) — preserve these verbatim.

3. Important Discoveries
   Constraints or requirements uncovered. Decisions made and their rationale. Approaches that were tried and didn't work (and why). Errors encountered and how they were resolved.

4. Next Steps
   Specific actions needed to complete the task. Any blockers or open questions. Priority order if multiple steps remain.

5. Context to Preserve
   User preferences or style requirements. Domain-specific details that aren't obvious from the conversation. Any promises or commitments made to the user.

Here's an example of the expected format:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process reviewing the conversation, identifying what matters]
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Task Overview:
   [User's core request and success criteria]

2. Current State:
   - [What has been completed]
   - [Key outputs or identifiers to preserve verbatim]

3. Important Discoveries:
   - [Key constraints, decisions, failed approaches, errors resolved]

4. Next Steps:
   - [Specific actions in priority order]

5. Context to Preserve:
   - [Preferences, commitments, domain details]
</summary>
</example>

Be concise but complete — err on the side of including information that would prevent duplicate work or repeated mistakes. Write in a way that enables immediate resumption of the task.
