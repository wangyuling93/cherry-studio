/**
 * Backfill a completed generation's output files into the live `currentPainting`
 * when they only landed in refreshed history.
 *
 * A background generation finishes by calling `usePaintingGeneration`'s
 * `applyIfVisible` — a no-op when the finishing painting isn't the visible one at
 * completion time (the user switched away, or the generation belongs to a prior,
 * now-unmounted page instance). In that case the in-memory draft keeps
 * `files: []` while the DB row — and therefore the refreshed history — gained the
 * outputs. The page does not automatically re-adopt history items, so the
 * visible in-memory painting needs this targeted result sync.
 *
 * The Artboard's reveal machine, having watched loading go false with no file,
 * then parks at `{ status: 'awaiting' }` forever — there is no `succeeded`
 * generationStatus for it to escape on. Copying the files in supplies the
 * `currentFile` the reveal is waiting for. Only `files` is synced — prompt,
 * params, inputFiles and every other local edit are preserved — and only when
 * history carries strictly more outputs than the local copy, so a fresh draft
 * (absent from history) and an in-flight generation (history not yet caught up)
 * are both left untouched and the sync is idempotent.
