# Consumer Review

The second review stage (after the Product Demand gate, before Architecture-First).
It audits whether an added or expanded shared surface has real, legitimate
consumers — code consumer archaeology, not implementation quality.

**Trigger**: decided by diff semantics, never by change label. Run this stage
whenever the diff adds or expands shared surface area — an API, DataApi/IpcApi
route, endpoint, parameter, type, field, config key, or architectural
extension point — regardless of whether the change is labelled `feat`, `fix`,
`refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, or tooling. A fix or a skill/tooling doc
change that introduces a new route, parameter, or extension point gets the
same consumer archaeology. Skip only when the diff adds and expands no shared
surface.

**Output**: surviving surfaces (with their decision) proceed to
Architecture-First review; removed, deferred, or consolidated surfaces are
reported with their decision and are not reviewed further for implementation
quality.

## Principle

Audit this causal chain before implementation quality:

`root outcome or invariant → normalized demand → owning layer → contract → consumer`

A call site proves usage, not legitimacy or shape. No call site raises the burden of proof, not an automatic rejection. Real demand may still have the wrong consumer or abstraction.

## Workflow

Apply every step to each added API, channel, parameter, type, field, config, or extension point.

### 1. Reconstruct the demand

List every new surface and exact consumed dimension; one valid consumer does not justify unused fields. Trace current and linked consumers to their user outcome, business rule, or system invariant. Inspect adjacent implementations, then ask: without the current API and history, would the demand remain and would this contract still be natural? Do not rely only on the PR description.

### 2. Audit consumer legitimacy

- **Legitimate**: uses the correct owner and boundary.
- **Compensating**: uses the nearest API and adds workarounds because the right capability is missing.
- **Legacy-shaped**: reflects obsolete formats, transitional architecture, or history.
- **Misplaced**: serves real demand in the wrong layer.

Parsing, retries, sequencing, duplicated state, check-then-act, or cross-layer access signal compensation. Treat these as unmet upstream demand, never endorsement of the current surface.

### 3. Normalize related demands

Strip names, historical formats, and workarounds from demand statements. Cluster by outcome, source of truth, owner, transaction, security, and lifecycle. Consolidate historical or caller-specific differences; keep contracts separate for genuine ownership, permission, atomicity, lifecycle, side-effect, or failure differences. Prefer a stable core with thin adapters, not duplicated workflows or a lowest-common-denominator API.

### 4. Classify evidence

- **Direct**: a legitimate current consumer uses the dimension.
- **Committed**: a concrete consumer exists in the same change or linked near-term work.
- **Architectural**: a minimal seam must precede consumers to protect a concrete invariant.
- **Unsupported speculation**: only a possible future is named, without a concrete scenario, owner, or omission cost.

Direct consumption proves pressure, not placement or shape.

### 5. Test architectural demand

For a surface without a legitimate current consumer, require all five:

1. A concrete consumer class or extension scenario;
2. The owning layer and protected invariant;
3. A causal omission cost, such as boundary violations, duplicated mechanisms, incompatible implementations, security gaps, or migration lock-in;
4. Why the seam must exist before its first consumer; and
5. The smallest stable mechanism that protects the invariant.

Reject "future features", "flexibility", "centralization", "technical constraints", or "migration risk" without linked evidence and a causal failure. If the test fails, defer or remove. If it passes, preserve only the minimal paved road and remove guessed dimensions.

### 6. Check responsibility and overlap

Place behavior by ownership, not line count. Centralize security, permissions, transactions, invariants, and shared policy; leave presentation and caller-specific composition in consumers. Prefer try-the-operation when the owner can enforce atomically.

Compare contracts by semantics, owner, permissions, exposure, atomicity, lifecycle, failure model, and cost. Shared data alone does not prove duplication; reuse only when these are equivalent.

### 7. Decide, then hand off

Choose one outcome per surface or normalized group:

- **Keep**: demand and shape are justified.
- **Narrow**: remove unsupported dimensions.
- **Split**: separate a valid core from unrelated concerns.
- **Consolidate**: merge surfaces expressing one demand.
- **Replace**: keep the demand, change consumer, owner, or abstraction.
- **Defer**: do not commit a possible demand yet.
- **Remove**: no demand remains or an equivalent contract owns it.

Report root outcome, evidence, consumer legitimacy, essential differences, owner, alternatives, and decision first. Only surviving surfaces continue to Architecture-First and Implementation review.

Ownership findings here and in Architecture-First overlap by design: this stage
asks whether the surface should exist and who should own it;
`cherry-review-guidance.md` asks whether the code that exists respects the
documented boundaries. Report one finding per defect at the earlier stage, and
apply the fix-altitude rule from `cherry-review-guidance.md` § Fix
Recommendation Policy to both.

## Rationalization Guards

| Claim | Response |
|---|---|
| "The API is clean; the types are elegant." | Quality cannot justify existence. |
| "It has consumers." | Verify legitimacy and exact consumption; workarounds endorse nothing. |
| "It has no consumers." | Run the five-part architectural test; absence alone decides nothing. |
| "The export is unused; add a test." | Tests verify behavior; they do not create demand. |
| "The architecture will need it." | Name the invariant, causal omission cost, consumer class, why now, and minimal seam. |
| "A technical constraint requires it." | Trace the constraint to root demand; constraints are not axioms. |
| "Existence is the architect's call." | Authority neither exempts demand review nor reduces it to a nit. |
| "The caller can compute it in one line." | Place policy by ownership and invariants, not code length. |
| "The existing API returns the same data." | Compare full semantics before declaring duplication. |
| "These consumers differ slightly." | Prove differences are semantic, not historical or caller-specific. |
| "It is forward-compatible or additive." | Keep only concrete needs; additive contracts carry permanent cost. |

## Red Flags

Pause and restart from Step 1 when:

- Implementation comments accumulate before stating root demand, evidence, and legitimate consumers.
- A call site is treated as proof that the contract belongs here or has the right shape.
- Zero current consumption is treated as automatic rejection or permission to accept an architectural claim.
- A compensating or hack-heavy consumer is used to freeze its workaround into the shared contract.

## Calibration

- Linked independent modules would otherwise import privileged internals: **keep the minimal registration seam; remove guessed knobs**.
- A renderer parses raw errors and retries because no atomic operation exists: **replace the abstraction rather than expand the error taxonomy**.
