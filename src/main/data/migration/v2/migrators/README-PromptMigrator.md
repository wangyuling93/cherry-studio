# PromptMigrator

`PromptMigrator` migrates both v1 quick-phrase stores into the single v2 `prompt` table. Assistant ownership is intentionally discarded because v2 exposes one global prompt list.

## Data Sources

| Data | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Global quick phrases | Dexie `quick_phrases` | Optional table in the v1 `CherryStudio` IndexedDB database |
| Assistant quick phrases | Redux `state.assistants.assistants[].regularPhrases` | Stored inline on each assistant |
| Preset quick phrases | Redux `state.assistants.presets[].regularPhrases` | Presets share the v1 Assistant shape |
| Default assistant quick phrases | Redux `state.assistants.defaultAssistant.regularPhrases` | Separate slot that may duplicate or diverge from `assistants[0]` |

The absence of the Dexie table does not stop migration. Redux assistant phrases are still prepared and inserted.

## Field Mapping

| v1 `QuickPhrase` | v2 `prompt` |
|------------------|-------------|
| `id` | `id`; valid unique UUIDs are preserved, while missing, invalid, or conflicting IDs are regenerated |
| `title` | `title`; trimmed, empty or invalid titles become `Untitled`, and titles above the v2 limit are truncated without splitting a Unicode surrogate pair |
| `content` | `content`; variable syntax is preserved |
| `order` | Used to restore the global quick-phrase sequence before assigning `orderKey` |
| `createdAt` | `createdAt`; preserve valid date values, otherwise use `updatedAt` or the migration timestamp |
| `updatedAt` | `updatedAt`; preserve valid date values, otherwise use the normalized `createdAt` |

No assistant identifier is written to the target table.

## Ordering

The target table has one whole-table fractional order:

1. Dexie global phrases come first, sorted by descending legacy `order` to reproduce v1's canonical old-to-new sequence.
2. Redux phrases follow in source order: `assistants[]`, `presets[]`, then `defaultAssistant`.
3. Each `regularPhrases` array keeps its stored order.
4. `assignOrderKeysInSequence()` stamps the combined sequence once.

This keeps the existing global migration order stable and deterministically appends the newly preserved assistant data.

## Duplicate IDs

The v1 Redux state can contain the same assistant data in multiple slots, especially the default assistant.

- Same ID, title, and content: keep the first row and count later rows as skipped duplicates. Timestamp-only differences do not create another prompt.
- Same ID but different title or content: preserve both rows. The first row keeps the v1 ID; each later conflicting row receives a new UUID.
- Missing or non-UUID ID: preserve the phrase under a generated UUID. Repeated non-empty legacy IDs still participate in duplicate detection before regeneration.
- Different IDs: preserve both rows even when their title and content match. The migrator does not infer that separately-created user records are duplicates.

Source precedence is global Dexie phrases, `assistants[]`, `presets[]`, then `defaultAssistant`.

## Validation

A candidate is rejected as invalid when its content cannot satisfy the v2 prompt contract (for example, it is missing, empty, or exceeds the v2 limit), or when an existing `regularPhrases` container is malformed. Missing IDs, invalid IDs, titles, and timestamps are normalized instead of dropping otherwise usable content.

Identical rows that reuse an ID are skipped separately as duplicates. A non-array `regularPhrases` value counts as one invalid source container, so it contributes to both `sourceCount` and `skippedCount` instead of disappearing from the migration report.

Before insertion and again after migration, every row is checked against the shared v2 prompt field schemas. Validation reports:

- `sourceCount`: all global and assistant candidates;
- `skippedCount`: invalid candidates plus identical duplicate IDs;
- `targetCount`: rows present in `prompt` after execution.

The target count must exactly equal the number of prepared rows. The migration engine clears the target table before a run, so extra or missing rows indicate a migration error.

## Execution

The combined prompt list is inserted in batches of 100 inside one SQLite transaction. This keeps the migration atomic while staying below SQLite's bound-variable limit for arbitrarily large imported assistant or preset lists.
