/**
 * Stuck-loop detection for repeated Bash calls that never produce new output.
 *
 * The recorder (a PostToolUse/PostToolUseFailure hook) appends one entry per Bash execution, plus a
 * break-marker when a mutating tool completes; the response is two-tiered (the same shape as
 * Cline's soft/hard loop guard): once the trailing run of one normalized command reaches
 * BASH_NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD with a single unchanged fingerprint, the next identical call is
 * allowed with a warning so the model can self-correct; only at BASH_NO_PROGRESS_HARD_THRESHOLD
 * does the `bash-repeat-no-progress` guard rule deny it outright. Output that changes at all — new
 * bytes, different error text — counts as progress and resets the signal, as does any completed
 * workspace mutation or a user interrupt (Esc).
