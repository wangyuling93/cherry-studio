/**
 * Module-level store sharing keyboard selection and jump intents between the
 * sidebar search box (settings layout) and the results page (child route).
 *
 * TEMPORARY LEGACY IMPLEMENTATION — do not extend this global protocol:
 * the store is window-global while search state logically belongs to one
 * settings tab, so two coexisting settings tabs can briefly overwrite each
 * other's selection/jump/highlight intent. Accepted as low-risk: every field
 * is recoverable ephemeral UI state, and <Activity> hide runs unmount
 * cleanups, so a hidden tab releases liveQuery and its jump handler instead
 * of leaking them. The recognized pendingFocus intent writers are the search
 * results page's goTo and the URL translator (SettingsFocusUrl) —
 * SettingsFocusScroll only consumes/clears it, and more writers do not
 * extend the protocol. EXIT CONDITION: once tab session identity/ownership
 * is unified (the per-tab session class of bugs, e.g. #18885 / #18879), delete
 * this module and move the state to the owning tab's context/provider.
