 * cherry-tools / assistant-MCP agent-session approval policy.

 * Consumed by the Claude Code runtime (settingsBuilder allowlist + tool-policy snapshot in
 * `agentTools`) to decide which cherry-tools an agent may call without a per-call approval prompt.
 * This derivation is main-only — the tool-*name* constants it builds on (`KB_MANAGE_TOOL_NAME`,
 * `WEB_SEARCH_TOOL_NAME`, …) stay cross-process in `@shared/ai/builtinTools`, but no renderer code
 * reaches the approval policy itself, so it lives in main per the shared-layer boundary.
